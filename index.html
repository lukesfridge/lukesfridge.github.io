<h2><u>RapidAI</u></h2>
<p>RapidAI is a simple chatbot with text to speech capabilities. The TTS is provided by Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>The only words it recognises at the moment are: "hello", "hi", "hola" & "yo". But these words can be used in conjunction with others, for example "hello mate" would still be recognised.</p>
