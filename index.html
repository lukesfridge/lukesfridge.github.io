<h2><u>PhillipAI</u></h2>
<p>PhillipAI is a basic chatbot with text to speech capabilities. The TTS is provided by Amazon Web Services. I made this because I was bored. I add features regularly.</p>
<p>The only words Phillip recognises at the moment are: "hello", "hi", "hola" & "hiya". But these words can be used in conjunction with others, for example "hello mate" would still be recognised.</p>
